| BUG-001 | Functional | Medium | Shopping list filtering was incomplete: meal type could not be filtered at all, and the UI lacked filters for category/unit/meal type despite displaying them. | Open Shopping page > Filters: only search/source/purchased available; API `/api/shopping/current` ignores `mealType` param. | `ListShoppingQuery` omitted `mealType` and `ShoppingService.applyFilters` had no meal-type branch; UI filter form omitted category/unit/meal type inputs. | Added `mealType` to query DTO, applied meal-type filter server-side, expanded UI filters to include category/unit/meal type, and added an e2e test for meal-type filtering. | `backend/src/shopping/dto/list-shopping.query.ts`, `backend/src/shopping/shopping.service.ts`, `backend/test/shopping.e2e-spec.ts`, `frontend/src/app/pages/shopping/shopping.component.ts`, `frontend/src/app/pages/shopping/shopping.component.html`, `frontend/src/app/pages/shopping/shopping.component.scss` | Verified by running the shopping e2e spec with `--runInBand`. |
